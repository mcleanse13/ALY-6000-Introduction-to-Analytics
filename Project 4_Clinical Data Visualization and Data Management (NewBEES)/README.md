Project Overview
This project explores a multi-part R programming workflow for descriptive statistics, visualization, and data management using clinical and health-related datasets. The analysis examines relationships between tumor size, inpatient days, and gender using regression and visualization techniques, then transitions into advanced data manipulation tasks focused on data cleaning, variable transformation, and handling missing values.

Methods and Tools
The analysis employs R packages including ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, vcd, and Hmisc to conduct statistical summaries, build scatterplots and strip charts, and perform data transformations such as log computations, categorical variable creation, and record filtering. Key visualization steps include scatter plots of inpatient days versus tumor size, stratified by gender, and strip charts representing surgical recovery patterns. Descriptive statistics (mean, variance, and standard deviation) are computed to summarize clinical outcomes and compare distributions across treatment groups.

Key Learning Objectives

Practice importing, exploring, and visualizing clinical datasets in R.

Compute descriptive and inferential statistics for continuous variables.

Apply data wrangling methods such as renaming, subsetting, and managing missing values.

Develop categorical encodings and transformations for health metrics.

Utilize visualization techniques (strip charts, scatter plots) to reveal trends and outliers in healthcare data.

Summary of Findings
Through scatterplot analyses, the data revealed positive relationships between tumor size and inpatient recovery days, with noticeable variance across gender. Additional descriptive statistics and strip charts demonstrated differences between actual and normally distributed inpatient days, suggesting non-normality and variability among patients. Data management procedures ensured a cleaner dataset by removing incomplete cases and reclassifying categorical variables for downstream analysis.
