## Overview
This project introduces fundamental R programming concepts and vector operations used in data analysis. The assignment focuses on building a strong foundation in syntax, data structures, and functional programming within RStudio. Students were tasked with creating a fully reproducible R script and a corresponding report that demonstrates their ability to compute, manipulate, and visualize data efficiently.

## Objectives
- Develop comfort using RStudio projects and environment management.
- Practice arithmetic operations, logical statements, and vector manipulation.
- Apply R functions such as `sum()`, `mean()`, `median()`, `seq()`, `rep()`, `sort()`, and others to analyze and summarize data.
- Utilize the **tidyverse** package for data wrangling and visualization.
- Explore dataset `ds_salaries.csv` to practice filtering, selecting, mutating, and plotting data with `ggplot2`.
- Produce visualizations that illustrate relationships between job titles and salaries.

## Files Included
- `Lastname_Project1.R`: R script containing all solutions, vector operations, and tidyverse analyses.  
- `Lastname_Project1_Report.pdf`: Four-page report summarizing methods, findings, and visualizations in APA format.  
- Supporting datasets (e.g., `ds_salaries.csv`) used for data analysis and visualization.

## Key Learnings
This project strengthened understanding of core R syntax, reproducible workflows, and data cleaning. It also introduced fundamental data visualization techniques using **ggplot2** and promoted best practices for script organization and documentation.
