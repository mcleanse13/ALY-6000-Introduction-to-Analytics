# Project 3: Goodreads Book Ratings Analysis (ALY 6000)

## üìñ Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of books sourced from Goodreads (via Kaggle) to explore patterns in book ratings, publication trends, and publisher activity. Using **R**, various statistical and visualization techniques were applied to examine measures of central tendency, dispersion, and distribution across tens of thousands of book entries.

## üéØ Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the dataset using `janitor` and `lubridate`.
- Visualize trends in ratings, pages, and publication years using histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, and Pareto charts.
- Summarize publisher-level performance and cumulative distributions.
- Compare population and sample statistics for mean, variance, and standard deviation.
- Present an executive summary with findings, visualizations, and key takeaways.

## üß† Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation** using `janitor`, `dplyr`, and `lubridate`
- **Data Visualization** with `ggplot2`, `ggthemes`, and `ggeasy`
- **Statistical Analysis**: descriptive statistics, population vs. sample comparisons
- **Custom Function Development** for computing mean, variance, and standard deviation
- **Data Storytelling**: translating analytical insights into written recommendations (APA-style report)

## üóÇÔ∏è Files
- `Lastname_Project3.R`: R script containing data cleaning, analysis, and visualization code.
- `Lastname_Project3_Report.pdf`: Written report summarizing findings, visuals, and recommendations.
- `books.csv`: Dataset used in the analysis (Goodreads dataset, modified for class use).

## üß© Key Visualizations
- Histogram of book ratings (binwidth = 0.25)
- Boxplot of book page counts
- Pareto chart of publisher book counts (1990‚Äì2020)
- Scatter plot of pages vs. ratings colored by publication year
- Line plot showing total number of books rated per year

## üßæ Summary
This project provided hands-on experience with R-based statistical programming and visualization techniques. By cleaning, transforming, and analyzing a large dataset, I developed stronger proficiency in using R for data exploration, statistical computation, and professional data presentation.
